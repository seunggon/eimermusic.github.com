<p><em>(2008)</em></p>

<p>
This album blew my mind completely. It not only shows a personal side to Kanye as a song-writer. The coolest thing is that the album could more or less have been produced in any bedroom studio in the world. We all have the tools at home to make this album... we are just not as good as Kanye. Damn!</p>




<p>
That is the last milestone for now...

<p><em>(2006)</em></p>

<p>
I stumbled upon this album on bleep.com by mistake. What a find. So dirty. So atmospheric. Nothing like "normal" Dub Step. Really in a genre of his own. It also helped that he (William Bevan) remained very anonymous for a very long time. No interviews, no real name, nothing. The lines spoken by Benicio del Toro and Forrest Whittaker (I believe they are real samples and not re-creations) help set the spooky mood of the album.  </p>

<p>
I love a lot of Rupert's work but Modus Operandi was the one that made me take notice in the tidal wave of half-assed D'n'B from the late '90s. To get the best of Photek, though, you need to dig out the rarer tracks. My old favorites are Knightvision and Ni Ten Ichi Ryu. These days I listen to his brief stint in the more laid back arena. Halogen and Lost Blue Heaven from Solaris (the album, not the soundtrack) the tracks I am referring to. The rest of that album is not to my taste though.</p>

<p><em>(2002)</em></p>

<p>
This soundtrack is a pure flash of genius. I'd say it has a lot to do with making the film a pretty good film and on its own the music is just as good. Watching Solaris for the first time I could not wait for the credits so I could see who had made this magical music. I love walking with this music in my headphones. It turn the most boring walk into a surreal experience.</p>

<p>
The first I heard of Lamb was a remix of Gold on a Future Music cover CD. Lamb also have some great tracks on their later albums, but never managed to equal their debut. D'n'B with real vocals and real instruments... and on top of this in 3/4 and 7/8 and whatever else Andy and Lou could come up with. Inspiring and still sounds fresh today. This is the kind of music I which I could and repeatedly fail in attempting to make. Notable mention goes to Lullaby from Fear of Fours. Fantastic track.</p>
