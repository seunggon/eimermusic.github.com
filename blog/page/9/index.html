  <div class="entry-content"><p>
Dealing with configurations for multiple domains (environments) is always a topic for discussion. I wanted to share my way of dealing with this common problem. This will not be right for all, which is the point. If this does not suit you, there are a few links at the bottom.
</p>


<h3>What will this do?</h3>

<p>
Simplify updates using SCM (git pull anyone?).<br />
Ability to run a single vhost setting, single cake core, single app directory for multiple subdomains.<br />
Each subdomain is it&#8217;s own application not simply an alias.<br />
Can run domain-sensitive shell tasks.
</p>


<h3>Apache first.</h3>

<p>
(or whatever you use)<br />
Just create a vhost and keep adding aliases for each new domain. 
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="">
ServerName client1.example.com
ServerAlias client2.example.com
ServerAlias client3.example.com
</pre>


<p>
(I don&#8217;t like wildcards here since I want any non-existing sub-domains to point to a non-cake &#8220;error site&#8221;)
</p>


<h3>Now Cake.</h3>

<p>
The domain switching is handled in bootstrap.php by looking at the HTTP_HOST environment variable. THis is not perfect. But I think it&#8217;s preferable to something like using &#8220;SetEnv&#8221; in htaccess or the vhost. This is simply because that if Apache isn&#8217;t providing the server name then you probably can&#8217;t see the set parameter either.
Shell access, you say? Well, that is where the first of the two if clauses in bootstrap.php comes in. More on that in a minute.
</p>




<h4>bootstrap.php</h4>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
&lt;?php
// Initial defaults go at the top, for example:
Configure::write('Config.language', 'swe');


// Load domain-specific config
if ( isset($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']) ) { // web
    $bootstrap = CONFIGS .'domains'.DS.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].'.php';
} elseif ( count($_SERVER['argv']) ) { // cli
    $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] = $_SERVER['argv'][count($_SERVER['argv'])-1];
    $bootstrap = CONFIGS .'domains'.DS.$_SERVER['argv'][count($_SERVER['argv'])-1].'.php';
}
if ( file_exists($bootstrap) ) {
    require($bootstrap); 
} else {
    echo 'No configuration could be loaded for domain '.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].'. Exiting...';
    exit;
}   


// At the bottom you can override configurations if you found you had to.
// This is also where you define defaults for constants. (keeps the if out of the domain file)
if ( !defined('CLIENT_NAME') ) {
    define('CLIENT_NAME', 'No Client');
}

</pre>




<h4>Domain files</h4>


<p>
In <b>app/config/</b> I create a folder called <b>domains</b>. In it, I keep each domain-specific configuration file named after each domain.
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="">
client1.example.com.php
client2.example.com.php
client3.example.com.php
myapp.site.php  <-- my local dev setup also gets it's own file.
myapp.local.php  <-- someone elses local setup.
</pre>




<h4> client1.example.com.php</h4>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
&lt;?php
// this file will mostly contain modifications of the defaults from bootstrap.php
Configure::write('Config.language', 'eng');
define('CLIENT_NAME', 'Client One');


// But this is important. I set the database setting here!
Configure::write('Database.config', array(
    'default' => array(
        'driver' => 'mysqli_ex',
        'persistent' => false,
        'host' => 'localhost',
        'port' => '',
        'login' => 'client1',
        'password' => 'client1',
        'database' => 'client1',
        'schema' => '',
        'prefix' => '',
        'encoding' => 'utf8'
    ),
    'test' => array(
        'driver' => 'mysqli_ex',
        'persistent' => false,
        'host' => 'localhost',
        'port' => '',
        'login' => 'testing',
        'password' => 'testing',
        'database' => 'probably not',
        'schema' => '',
        'prefix' => '',
        'encoding' => 'utf8'
    )
));

</pre>




<h4>Database settings</h4>


<p>
As you can see I set the database configuration in the domain file. I prefer this to having a long list of database settings in database.php or a second file for each domain in the domains folder. The database settings are loaded like this:
</p>




<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
&lt;?php
class DATABASE_CONFIG {
    var $default = array(
        'driver' => 'mysqli_ex',
        'persistent' => false,
        'host' => 'localhost',
        'port' => '',
        'login' => 'root',
        'password' => '',
        'database' => 'default',
        'schema' => '',
        'prefix' => '',
        'encoding' => 'utf8'
    );

    function __construct () {       
        $config = Configure::read('Database.config');
        if ( !is_array($config) ) {
            // screaming exit here?
            return;
        }
        foreach ( $config as $name=>$data ) {
            $this->$name = $data;
        }
    }
    
}

</pre>




<p>
The database file dynamically creates the attributes (class-variables) from the keys in the domain-specific file. This is probably illegal php by some strict setting but I still sleep well at night. The reason I do this and not, like some other people, simply set the &#8220;default&#8221; to whatever I have in the domain-file (see links at the bottom) is that I sometimes need several databases accessible from the application. This way I can dynamically create as many as I like.
</p>


<h3>And there shall be a shell.</h3>

<p>
The shell access is always a problem. You have no server-environment available and no Cake-magic to fake it, as far as I know. The fix is simple but also the least robust part of this setup. Bootstrap is set to accept the domain as a shell argument. 
</p>


<h4>part of bootstrap.php again</h4>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
&lt;?php

if ( isset($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']) ) { // normal web access
    $bootstrap = CONFIGS .'domains'.DS.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].'.php';
} elseif ( count($_SERVER['argv']) ) { // we need a cli agrument (argv will always exist so this is a bit pointless)
    $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] = $_SERVER['argv'][count($_SERVER['argv'])-1];
    $bootstrap = CONFIGS .'domains'.DS.$_SERVER['argv'][count($_SERVER['argv'])-1].'.php';
}


</pre>


<p>
These lines set the server name and the include file from the last shell argument. That is the less robust part and something you may wish to modify if you find it breaks your shells.
</p>


<br />


<p>
My hourly script is runs like this:
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="">
/path/to/cake/cake/console/cake hourly client1.example.com
</pre>


<p>
And from cron that would be:
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="">
/path/to/cake/cake/console/cake -app /path/to/cake/app/ hourly client1.example.com
</pre>


<p>
I have even verified that the HTTP_HOST survives a requestAction(), good old requesrtAction ;)
</p>


<h3>Anything to look out for?</h3>

<p>
This technique works. I have used a variation of this on a live application for almost 3 years. Before devising this tweaked and updated version I looked at the suggestions from blogs and posts around the web. For my purposes this is the best I have seen. But it is not without it&#8217;s potential problems.
</p>


<br />


<p>
Caching is not exhaustively tested. I can say that Cake&#8217;s default caching of models and &#8220;persistent&#8221; things are not adversely affected. Other caching, I don&#8217;t know. You can specify &#8220;domains&#8221; for cache files which would be a way to get around problems.
</p>


<br />


<p>
Logs will be jumbled together. I have so far had to patch the CakePHP core to achieve domain-specific logs. See update below.
</p>


<br />


<p>
Uploaded files should be pointed to domain-specific folders. You don&#8217;t want a file called trade-secrets.doc to be accessed by the wrong domain!
</p>


<h3>That&#8217;s it</h3>

<p>
Thanks for reading. If you are not bored yet below are a few blog posts that I used as inspiration and reference in varying amounts.

<h3>Update: Hacking the core to redirect the tmp folder</h3>

<p>
I did a minimal patch to the CakePHP (via git, updates are very painless with simple patches).
</p>




<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="xml">
diff --git a/cake/config/paths.php b/cake/config/paths.php  
index 6a6449f..075313a 100644

        define('APP', ROOT.DS.APP_DIR.DS);

+       include_once APP . 'config' . DS . 'paths.php';

  * Path to the application's models directory.  
  */
</pre>




<p>
I then add the necessary file app/config/paths.php and put this into it:
</p>




<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
if ( !isset($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']) ) { 
    if ( count($_SERVER['argv']) ) { // cli 
        $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] = $_SERVER['argv'][count($_SERVER['argv'])-1]; 
    } else { 
        echo 'No server name is available. Halting...'; 
        exit; 
    } 
} 

$tmp = APP.'tmp'.DS .'domains'.DS.$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'].DS; 
    //print_r($tmp); 
if ( !is_dir($tmp) ) { 
    $old = umask(0);     
    @mkdir($tmp,0777,true); 
    @mkdir($tmp.'logs'.DS,0777,true); 
    @mkdir($tmp.'cache'.DS.'models'.DS,0777,true); 
    @mkdir($tmp.'cache'.DS.'persistent'.DS,0777,true); 
    @mkdir($tmp.'cache'.DS.'views'.DS,0777,true); 
    @mkdir($tmp.'sessions'.DS,0777,true); 
    umask($old); 
    if ( is_dir($tmp) ) { 
        if (!defined('TMP')) { 
            define('TMP', $tmp); 
        } 
    } else { 
        echo 'Specific temporary folder does not exist: '.$tmp.' - Halting...'; // ROOT.DS.APP_DIR.DS 
        exit; 
    } 
} else { 
    if (!defined('TMP')) { 
        define('TMP', $tmp); 
    } 
}
</pre>




<p>
This code will check that a domain-tmp exists or try to create it if it does not. Finally it defines TMP. I have kept the permissions very loose in this example. I suggest tightening it up before going public.
</p>


<p>
I had to hack the core, but that puts me into deployment nirvana. One source-tree on the server while keeping separate logs, cache, uploads and anything else kept in tmp.

<p>Using high-score lists or similar you often have a large number of rows where you want to know who is in 7th place or how well is id:254 doing.
This eliminates the slow looping in php of big result-sets by making a sub-query in MySQL.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="sql">
SET @rownum := 0;

SELECT * FROM (
SELECT @rownum := @rownum+1 AS rank, id, points
FROM highscores 
ORDER BY points DESC
) AS highscores WHERE id = 254;

This is a few lines of code and explanations explaining how to get HTTP Auth to check against your normal users table.
</p>


<br />


<p>
Intended audience:<br />
• You want to provide a protected RSS feed.<br />
• You want to provide a protected API.<br />
</p>


<br />


<p>
Prerequisites: <br />
• You should be familiar with the basics of the Security and Auth Comoponents.<br />
• You should be aware that this technique does have a slightly lower level of security than your normal logins.<br />
• Your application already has some form of authentication setup.<br />
• I will asume you are using Auth Component in your App Controller in the example.
</p>


<br />


<p>
The Cookbook does a good job of explaining how to setup simple protection for a controller or action using HTTP basic authentication. In these examples the usernames and passwords are all hard-coded. Setting things up so that the authentication uses your normal user-data (e.g. from a database) is pretty simple but not extensively documented.
</p>


<br />


<p>
Here is all the relevant code.
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
class MyController extends AppController {

    var $components = array('Security','RequestHandler');
    
    function beforeFilter() { 
        if ( $this->RequestHandler->isRss() ) { 
            $this->Auth->allow('index'); 
            $this->Security->loginOptions = array( 
                'type'=>'basic', 
                'login'=>'authenticate', 
                'realm'=>'MyRealm' 
            ); 
            $this->Security->loginUsers = array(); 
            $this->Security->requireLogin('index'); 
        } 
        parent::beforeFilter(); 
    } 
    
    function authenticate($args) { 
        $data[ $this->Auth->fields['username'] ] = $args['username']; 
        $data[ $this->Auth->fields['password'] ] = $this->Auth->password($args['password']); 
        if ( $this->Auth->login($data) ) { 
            return true; 
        } else { 
            $this->Security->blackHole($this, 'login'); 
            return false; 
        } 
    } 

    function index() {
        // this is a protected function now
    }
}
</pre>


<h3>A quick walkthrough</h3>

<p>
I will asume that authentication is setup globally in AppController. Naturally it is necessary to include the relevant components.

<ul>
<li>
First I check if the request is for the RSS feed. (If not the action authenticates like any other and renders a html view.)
</li>
<li>
Normal Authentication is disabled
</li>
<li>
loginOptions has set the &#8220;login&#8221; key containing the name of the method we want to handle authentication.
</li>
<li>
Then loginUsers is left blank (they wont be used), and login is required for the index action.
</li>
</ul>


<h4>authenticate</h4>


<ul>
<li>
$args contains the username and password. They are placed into a new array using the keys set for Auth.
</li>
<li>
Auth tries to login. if the login fails the request is actively &#8220;blackHoled&#8221;.
</li>
<li>
Returning true of false is just for show. It is ignored by Security component
</li>
</ul>




<br />


<p>
This is all that is needed to get started. It is not the safest authenticaiton in the world but using SSL alongside this technique will provide pretty good security for your API access.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I thought I&#8217;d chronicle my work migrating my fist CakePHP application to CakePHP 1.2 (rc3 at the time of writing). The application was originally written for CakePHP 1.0 (= the good old days). It has been updated to work with the latest versions 1.1 but has not really been rewritten much. 
</p>


<p>
Considering how much CakePHP has evolved and also how many beginner-mistakes I have put into this application, this migration will also describe some pretty huge optimizations that was possible because of new features and my improved knowledge of CakePHP.
</p>


<h3>About The Application</h3>

<p>
The application if called Fileshifter and it is a simple file manager and file sharing application. The original purpose was to complement an ftp server. Fileshifter is generally more simple to manage and easier for &#8220;average people&#8221; to handle. You have projects and upload files into them or download files from them. As admin you can manage user accounts and project permissions.
</p>


<p>
The English pages on the application-website are horribly out of date. Sorry. There are a few screen-casts in the Swedish section that might give some context to what I am writing about, though.
</p>


<p><a href="http://www.fileshifter.se/">http://www.fileshifter.se/</a>
</p>


<h3>First attempt. Aka: Oh crap, nothing works</h3>

<p>Just dropping my old application into CakePHP 1.2 clearly didn&#8217;t work. :)
I just got two errors. The second one was a fatal error which halted further execution in config/routes.php
</p>


<p>I went through all files in the config directory. This took a little while but I wanted to get the configurations identical to those I had before. One bonus for my application is the new configuration directive to not check the userAgent. This will be very useful for my upload actions that will be used by the java applet the application uses. In earlier versions I manually hacked the core to make this possible.
</p>


<h4>core.php</h4>


<p>Starting with a clean file from CakePHP 1.2 I changed the following things for my application. Not all as strictly necessary to get an application running.
</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Session.cookie</strong> - set to the same name as in the old application.</li>
<li><strong>Session.checkAgent</strong> - set to false globally for the time being. I will check if I can set this just in the relevant controller without causing problems.</li>
<li><strong>Security.salt</strong> - should always be altered. I kept part of the original string, moved things around and inserted some swedish words here and there just for fun.</li>
</ul>




<h4>bootstrap.php</h4>


<p>My old file set a few constants used to configure the application. A few of these I switched over to the new Configure class. Most, I left as constants since they are nothing you would ever change at runtime. For example the path to the root of the file area.<br/>
The current language was one of the ones I switched over. See below about i18n.
</p>


<h4>database.php</h4>


<p>Not a big problem here. The could have been left as is but I did copy over the login parameters to a fresh file. I noticed that the connect parameter does not need to be set for MySQL. I am not sure about before but now it is enough to set persistent to true.
</p>


<h4>routes.php</h4>


<p>The few routes I had defined only needed to call the method statically to continue to work. For example:</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
$Route->connect ('/', array('controller'=>'efs', 'action'=>'index'));
</pre>


<p>became:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
Router::connect('/', array('controller' => 'efs', 'action' => 'index'));
</pre>




<p>I also replaced all default files (index.php, .htaccess &#8230;). I did not bother to check which had changed. It was simpler to just replace them all with the new 1.2 versions.
</p>


<h3>File model clashes with the File class</h3>

<p>Since my application is a file manager I had a model called File. It actually took me a good while before I figured out that my File model clashes with the File class in the core. Time for some search and replace. All references to File was replaced with EfsFile (did not think of anything better). Most of it could be changed this simply, but I had to make a few manual adjustments. Cakes $useTable came in good use here. I did not have to alter the database just because I renamed the class.
</p>


<h3>Replacing authentication</h3>

<p>Next big problem is authentication. Since all data the user can interact with flows from the authenticated user account, this basically stops my application completely until I get the new authentication up and running. Lucky enough I was using an Auth component that works kind-of similar to the current Auth component in the core. There was still a lot of work but it could have been worse.
</p>


<p>I didn&#8217;t keep any of the code from the old authentication. What I did was take copy a lot of it over from another application where I first tried some basic 1.2 authentication. The code is pretty much straight out of the tutorials available all over the web.
</p>


<h3>Permissions</h3>

<p>In the original version I intentionally kept permissions to a minimum. Simplicity was the key and increased complexity and granularity in permissions will increase the workload for the administrator. This was of-course no bad thing when it came to updating the authentication. The old Component used a User model and a Permission model. I saw no reason to even have a model for permissions anymore since all I needed was &#8220;normal user&#8221; and &#8220;admin user&#8221;. I mapped this to a simple integer field in the users table. I can imagine that trying to migrate a role-based system can be a lot more work.
</p>


<h3>Transitioning old passwords</h3>

<p>I have managed to keep all the old passwords. They were md5 hashed without a salt so I was able to get it working by defining an authenticate object for Auth. I chose to make the User model the authenticate object. It feels natural to have password hashing there.
</p>


<p>In AppController::beforeFilter:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
$this->Auth->authenticate =& $this->Auth->getModel();
</pre>


<p>And in models/user.php I added:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
function hashPasswords($data) {
    if (is_array($data) && isset($data[$this->alias])) {
        if (isset($data[$this->alias]['email']) && isset($data[$this->alias]['pass'])) {
            $data[$this->alias]['pass'] = Security::hash($data[$this->alias]['pass'], 'md5', false);
        }
    }
    return $data;
}
</pre>




<p>One thing still on the todo-list is that I would rather try to manage a transitional system for the first release after this migration. Something where the password can be checked against both the old and new hash. Any login where the stored password matches the old hash will be replaced by the given password hashed using the new (more secure) system using a salt. If I can&#8217;t get that to work I have to make a judgement call wether to keep the old less safe passwords or require all users in all installations to renew their passwords. We&#8217;ll see&#8230;
</p>


<h3>Changing the code convention of the entire application</h3>

<p>This can be tedious if you plan to do it in one big pass. I decided to use this as an indicator of what code I had looked over and changed. Any method I altered or examined and decided not to alter was given a change in coding style to indicate that it was &#8220;approved&#8221; 1.2 code. If I had been happy with my old style I would not have done this, but since I planed to change it, this was a good way to do it.
</p>


<h3>Loading classes and other external code</h3>

<p>All the old methods of loading files have changed. No more uses(), no more vendor(). This is now all taken care of by App::import(). For example when I load a PEAR class to archive a whole folder:
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
vendor('Archive/Tar');
</pre>


<p>now reads:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
App::import('Vendor','Archive/Tar');
</pre>




<p>The component dealing with syncing with the filesystem nor loads the needed models in a single call, like this:</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
App::import('Model',array('Project','EfsFile'));
</pre>


<h3>Removing requestAction()</h3>

<p>Like so many starting out, I was seduced by requestAction(). Looking at my old code I remember believing that only the UsersController should manipulate the User model. That is partly why I turned to requestAction when one controller needed access to &#8220;another model&#8221;.
</p>


<p>My primary requestAction() was to call &#8220;/files/viewedBy/1/1&#8221; whenever a user selected a new file. This would log that the user has seen the file. By moving this code into the EfsFile model I was abel to take the request-time for these down quite a bit. With my test-data this went down to 0.15s from well over a second before. Partly because of the overhead of a request and partly because of Containable helping to optimize the data retrieval.
</p>


<h3>Hey, where did my data go?</h3>

<p>One new behavior introduced in CakePHP 1.2 RC3 may delete some data by accident. If an association has conditions, you should use the new array notation for conditions. If you delete a record and dependent is true, you expect the related record(s) to be deleted as well. If conditions is not an array you can delete delete all records of the related model, not just related ones. I have had this happen to my data for hasOne associations. I have not done extensive test to see if this affects other associations.
</p>


<p>This is straight out of manual as it was a while ago:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
class User extends AppModel {
    var $name = 'User';
    var $hasMany = array(
        'Comment' => array(
            'className' => 'Comment',
            'foreignKey' => 'user_id',
            'conditions' => 'Comment.status = 1',
            'order' => 'Comment.created DESC',
            'limit' => '5',
            'dependent'=> true
        )
    );
}
</pre>


<p>And this is the small but important change:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
class User extends AppModel {
    var $name = 'User';
    var $hasMany = array(
        'Comment' => array(
            'className' => 'Comment',
            'foreignKey' => 'user_id',
            'conditions' => array('Comment.status' => '1'),
            'order' => 'Comment.created DESC',
            'limit' => '5',
            'dependent'=> true
        )
    );
}
</pre>


<p>I believe even empty conditions can cause you problems:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
'conditions' => '',
</pre>


<p>it should be:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
'conditions' => array(),
</pre>


<p>I am not certain about that last bit but better safe than sorry, right?</p>

<h3>Hey, where did my data go? part 2</h3>

<p>There was a bug introduced in CakePHP 1.2 rc3 that anyone updating should be aware of. Cake can accidentally delete data in the join tables of your HABTM associations. This happens if the association is two-sided and you remove the &#8220;link&#8221; between two records. Any other record the associated record is linked to is also unlinked. I found this out the hard way. I then discovered a bug report in trac. The fix described there has worked for me in two applications for a few weeks now. See the ticket for details and example-code.
</p>


<p><a href="https://trac.cakephp.org/ticket/5579">https://trac.cakephp.org/ticket/5579</a></p>

<h3>Finding new data</h3>

<p>The Model methods find(), findAll() and so on have changed a lot. This required a lot of manual work, but since I could optimize thing at the same time and speed up the application noticeably I didn&#8217;t really mind the work. I also thing this new syntax is a lot easier to use.</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
$allProj = $this->Project->findAll(null,null,'Project.title ASC');
</pre>


<p>should now read:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
$allProj = $this->Project->find('all',array(
    'order' => 'Project.title ASC'
));
</pre>


<p>or better yet:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
$allProj = $this->Project->find('all',array(
    'order' => array('Project.title' => 'ASC')
));
</pre>


<p><em>Note: Keeping &#8220;ASC&#8221; in my example is not necessary but I like to have it there so I know at a glance what is going on.</em></p>

<p>OK, all find operations are now taken care of by find. The first parameter indicates the type of find to perform. Setting it to &#8220;first&#8221; will find a single record for example. The second parameter is an array, like in so many places in CakePHP 1.2. This should contain the additions you want to make to the query. As you can see order is one thing. Conditions is another. Fields is a third. I could never remember if order was parameter number 3,4 or 5. Now I don&#8217;t have to. I just add a key called order and a value with the ordering field and direction I want. It does not have to come before or after the conditions&#8230; all very nice.
</p>


<p>All of these parameters can be broken down into arrays themselves. This adds another layer of protection against sql injections. The conditions can even be broken down into ands and ors in a deep structure. Cake will construct a nice where-clause of them for you and keep track of all the parenthesis. See the manual for many examples of this. The same goes for deleteAll() and any other conditions throughout the application.
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
$result = $this->deleteAll( array(
    $this->alias.'.created <' => $deadline
));
</pre>


<p>Notice that the comparison operator is on the left side. This is new since CakePHP 1.2 RC2, I think.</p>

<h3>I can hardly contain myself</h3>

<p>Am am bursting with joy! Containable behavior is one of my favorite features in CakePHP 1.2. Containable is like find() on steroids.  It is like associations on acid. It is like&#8230; ok enough! The basic first step is to simple add this to the relevant models.</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
var $actsAs = array('Containable');
</pre>




<p>Containable is a behavior that helps you optimize your queries. Perviously all I could do was to set recursive and unbind a model. Containable sort-of does this for you, in a very intuitive way. Parts of the application has been sped up by a factor of 8. That is 8x the original request time, largely because of Containable.
<br />
It may sound like magic, but imagine this:<br />
<br />
<strong>User:</strong> habtm Project, habtm File<br />
<strong>Project:</strong> hasMany File, habtm User<br />
<strong>File:</strong> habtm User, belongsTo Project<br />
<br />
These three models can easily cause a lot of unnecessary data to be loaded since they relate to each-other in several ways. By taking advantage of some simple functionality in containable I was abel to eliminate most of the unused data from my queries. For example, loading a single file:
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
$data = $this->User->find('first', array(
    'conditions' => array('User.id'=>$this->userData['User']['id']),
    'contain' => array(
        'Project'=>array(
            'EfsFile'=>array(
                'conditions'=>array('EfsFile.id'=>$this->params['id'])
            )
        )
    )
));
</pre>




<p>In english: Find the currently logged in User. Contain the results to also include any related Project and to the project related File if the id of the file is the one we want.</p>




<p>This may look like a backwards way of loading a file. However this is quite effective since I only want the file to load is it is in a project that the current user has access to. Using the Set class (another great new feature in 1.2) it is no big problem picking out the file from the results. Just imagine the mess returned if I had set recursive to 2 instead&#8230; I would have loaded all files in all projects related to the user and I would have had to loop through the results to locate the one with the right id (making it a condition would not have worked). OK, that was an example from hell but I hope the point was made. Containable is your friend. Please check the manual for more complete details on how to use Containable.
</p>


<h3>New validation system</h3>

<p>I must admit, I did not have a lot of validation before. The validation I had was mostly custom validation code. Some of it even in the controller (ick!). One thing I did validate before was, naturally, login data. For example, validating uniqueness is a lot better in 1.2. And there is also support for multiple validation rules per field. Apart from changing the validation I had I also added a few rules for the files and projects. I still have to change my controller code to make better use of the validation errors and messages, though.
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
var $validate = array(
    'name'=>VALID_NOT_EMPTY,
    'login'=>VALID_NOT_EMPTY,
    'email'=>VALID_EMAIL
);
</pre>


<p>now reads:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
var $validate = array(
    'name' => array(
        'rule' => 'notEmpty',
        'message' => 'The name can not be left blank'
    ),
    'email' => array(
        'email' => array(
            'rule' => 'email',
            'message' => 'This is not a valid email.'
        ),
        'unique' => array(
            'rule' => 'isUnique',
            'message' => 'This email already used for another user.'
        )
    )
);
</pre>


<p>The error messages above have been replaced to make them more readable. They are in the form of translation keys in the real code.</p>

<h3>Synchronizing with the filesystem</h3>

<p>The application keeps its files and folders in the database. To enable admins to expose the files on their local network or a traditional ftp, there is a component that checks the filesystem for changes. I was able to optimize this comparison quite a bit. 
</p>


<p>My original code fetched all files and folders, queried the database and then compared the two using foreach loops. These become exponentially slower as the number of files grow. Comparing 100 files would result in 100*100 comparisons just to determine that nothing new has been added.
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
foreach ( $system as $sysFile ) {
    foreach ( $data as $dataFile ) {
        if ( $sysFile['EfsFile']['filename'] == $dataFile['EfsFile']['filename'] ) {
            // OK, this file exists already
        }
    }
}
</pre>




<p>The goal was to remove at least one of the foreach loops to keep the speed increase in check. Since these are Cake-style multi-dimensional arrays simple comparisons like array_diff() don&#8217;t work. The Set class was of-course a little slower than the foreach loops since it does basically the same thing, only a bit more advanced. 
</p>


<p>Once again I found that putting more responsibility on MySQL was the answer. My new code fetches all files and folders, loops through that data and queries the database to see if a known file can be found. Testing with about 3&#8217;000 files, I measured this code to be twice as fast as the original code. Checking 3&#8217;000 files in 14 folders now takes 4.5sec instead of 8.6sec.
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
foreach ( $system as $sysFile ) {
    $this->EfsFile->contain();
    $found = $this->EfsFile->find('first', array(
        'conditions' => array(
            'EfsFile.filename'=> $sysFile['filename'],
            'EfsFile.project_id'=> $current_project_id
        )
    ));
    if ( $found ) {
        // OK, this file exists already
    }
}
</pre>


<h3>Filesystem case sensitivity</h3>

<p>I got this strange error while testing. Each sync with the filesystem would result in duplicate files in a certain project. Turned out the problem was one of case sensitivity. Some filesystems are case sensitive, some are not. PHP definitely is case sensitive when doing simple comparisons like $filename1 == $filename2. This can cause problems when files and folders are added and renamed outside of my application. Renaming a folder test => Test will still find the same folder when on a case insensitive system but it will not be considered the same folder by the sync code discussed above. I needed a way to handle this problem. Here is what I came up with:
</p>


<p>in config/bootstrap.php</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
define('EFS_FILESYSTEM_TYPE', 'ci'); // filesystem is set to case insensitive
</pre>


<p>in vendors/basics.php (my file of small handy global functions)</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
// returns a filename or foldername in the correct case for comparison
function file_case($str) {
    if ( EFS_FILESYSTEM_TYPE == 'ci' ) {
        return low($str); // Filesystem in case insensitive
    } else {
        return $str; // Filesystem in case sensitive
    }
}
</pre>




<p>That is ok and it works. But how many of my customers actually know what filesystem they are running? These are people who choose this app for its simplicity. Can&#8217;t I use some function to find the filesystem type automatically? Well, yes I can. I looked for some internal php mechanism but found none. There may be plenty of smarter ways to do this but here is what I did:
in vendors/basics.php (my file of small handy global functions)
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
// returns a filename or foldername in the correct case for comparison
function file_case($str) {
    if ( !defined('EFS_FILESYSTEM_TYPE') ) {
        if ( is_file(strtoupper(__FILE__)) ) {
            define('EFS_FILESYSTEM_TYPE', 'ci'); // Filesystem in case insensitive
        } else {
            define('EFS_FILESYSTEM_TYPE', 'cs'); // Filesystem in case sensitive
        }
    }
    
    if ( EFS_FILESYSTEM_TYPE == 'ci' ) {
        return strtolower($str); // Filesystem in case insensitive
    } else {
        return $str; // Filesystem in case sensitive
    }
}
</pre>




<p>I checks &#8220;the same file&#8221; twise. Once with the filename capitalized and once in all lowercase. If they both exist then the filesystem should be case insensitive. This works when tested on HFS+ volumes of both types.
</p>


<h3>Re-factoring stupid noob code</h3>

<p>A post on the CakePHP Google group got me thinking about a component I coded for this application. It is (or was) a Ticket component for maintaining temporary tickets of the type many websites use for password resets and registration activations.
</p>


<p></p>When I started looking at this old component I realized that the only reason this was a component at all was vanity. I thought a component would be &#8220;kewl&#8221; and really wanted to create a component. This was of-course horribly wrong. The component may still be published here:
</p>
<a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/ticket-component-resetting-user-passwords">http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/ticket-component-resetting-user-passwords</a></p>

<p>The component is really just a proxy to the Ticket model storing the tickets. I re-factored the code in the component into the model and included the model in the controllers that previously included the component.
</p>


<p>Unfortunately I had to rename most of the methods from the component since they clashed with internal Model methods like set() and del(). What took the most time was finding new names for these methods. Out of frustration I (temporarily) just called them setTicket() and drop(). Ugly, yes. I hate putting the class name in the method name&#8230; totally useless but my English vocabulary doesn&#8217;t include a good synonym.
</p>


<h3>l10n and i18n</h3>

<p>The original application used my own code for language management. I had a php-file for each language. All labels were defined in an associative array in those files. Like this:
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
$labels = array();

//--  login page
$labels['login_username']  = 'Login Id';
$labels['login_password']  = 'Password';
$labels['login_login']     = 'Login';
</pre>




<p>The first step was to convert these files into gettext po-files. It was a matter of search and replace for 90% of it. Some comments had to be moved and changed manually and things of this nature. The results looked something like this:
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
# login page
msgid "login_username"
msgstr "Login Id"

msgid "login_password"
msgstr "Password"

msgid "login_login"
msgstr "Login"
</pre>


<p>These files were put into the relevant folders. E.g. locale/eng/LC_MESSAGES/default.po</p>

<p>The second step was to replace my own translation function with the built-in __(). I have never used that function directly. This is mainly since I prefer to have my strings returned and not output. I put a proxy function into my bootstrap which alters the default of the second argument.
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
function ___($singular, $return = true) {
    return __($singular, $return);
}
</pre>


<p>I managed to change all the calls to $lang->show(&#8216;some_string&#8217;) to ___(&#8216;some_string&#8217;) in one glorious find and replace. That&#8217;s my kind of migration.
</p>


<p>The third and final change was to alter the language switching. I kept this in my bootstrap and only change it to write the configuration for the selected language. The old code is the commented lines. I kept the rest of my old code. As you can see it still uses cookies and it works just as well as before.
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
if (isset($_COOKIE['EFS_LANG'])) {
    //define('EFS_LANG', $_COOKIE['EFS_LANG']);
    Configure::write('Config.language', $_COOKIE['EFS_LANG']);
} else {
    //define('EFS_LANG', 'sv');
    Configure::write('Config.language', 'sv');
}
</pre>


<h3>Changing all view-files to use .ctp extension</h3>

<p>This takes all of 5 minutes and has absolutely no effect on the functionality of the application. It just feels better and considering the work involved why not? I just ran everything in the views folder through a filename changer (NameChanger for Mac OS X) and I was done.
</p>


<h3>Changes to form and html helpers</h3>

<p>Any previous call to html helper to generate a form element needs to be switched over to use the form helper. This did not affect my application much. Most html did not make use of either helper. I remember feeling it was less intuitive to make php calls to generate html instead of just writing the html directly. The application does not have a lot of forms either.
</p>


<p>With the login form as an example here is some of the things to look out for in views.
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
<label for="UserLogin"><?php echo $lang->show('login_username'); ?></label>
<?php
$html->input('User/login',array(
    'style'=>"width:150px;"
));
?>
</pre>


<p>now reads:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
$form->input('User.email',array(
    'label'=>___('login_username'), 
    'div' => false, 
    'style'=>'width:150px;'
));
</pre>


<p>This is one area where the new helpers really shine. Just setting the label property IS simpler than writing the whole tag manually. since my layout did not have divs before I simply set that key to false to avoid the default div around my text field.
</p>


<p>Also notice that $html is replaced by $form and that the reference to the model field uses the new dot-notation. 
</p>


<p>I also switched to email logins, but that has nothing to do with the migration. I started out using usernames. When I created the feature to reset passwords a valid email address was necessary and the last big update changed to prefer email logins but still allowed old usernames during a transitional period. This version will deprecate the old logins once and for all.
</p>


<h3>Don&#8217;t render your elements</h3>

<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. Keep on using your elements. It is just the name of the method has changed from renderElement() to just element(). The application was full of these but this was another one of those things that a quick find and replace could solve in minutes. I did not find any problems afterwards. The parameters appear to work the same. 
</p>


<h3>Cleaning up my urls</h3>

<p>Besides cleaning up some of my mess in config/routes.php I did some spring-cleaning of the urls  in my views and controllers. This is not strictly necessary but it may come in handy if, or when, I want to create some new custom routes. Changing all urls to arrays instead of simple strings does look like a lot of complexity with little benefit.
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
'/users/edit'
</pre>


<p>becomes:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
array('controller'=>'users', 'action'=>'edit')
</pre>




<p>Clearly harder to read, right? The benefit is that I can now decide to create an &#8220;alias&#8221; in routes.php so that links to /profile should go to the edit action of the users controller. As if by magic, all links and redirects to that editing screen will change from /users/edit to /profile. Cool!
</p>


<p>Another little nice (new?) feature I found was for the classic &#8220;logo links back to start-page&#8221;. Every website in the world has this and it can be done very nicely. This mess:
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
<a href="<?php echo $html->url('/'); ?>"><?php echo $html->image('fileshifter_logo_bar.gif',array('alt'=>'Fileshifter logo'))?></a>
</pre>


<p>could be written like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
<?php echo $html->image('fileshifter_logo_bar.gif',array('alt'=>'Fileshifter logo', 'url'=>'/')); ?>
</pre>




<p>The image method accepts an url parameter and creates a link around the image for you. It does look nice and clean. If you need some attributes set for the link you can also use the link method and just put a call to the image method where the &#8220;text label&#8221; for the link is set. See the manual, it has a clear example of it. It is a lot simpler than I make it sound.
</p>


<h3>Consolidating layouts and views.</h3>

<p>Some of my old view code was duplicated because I did not know all the tricks back then. For example, my layouts (three of them) were almost identical but they has a few things that set them apart.
</p>


<p>Since data for the current user is always available to the view, one simple fix was to add an if-clause that would output the correct menu-items  for each situation.
</p>


<p>The other problem I had was that $content_for_layout had to be wrapped and accompanied by different code for different sections of the application. The fix is simple but not one I knew about two years ago. I made a common base-layout:
</p>


<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
--base.ctp--
...lots of html for menu and header...

<?php echo $content_for_layout; ?>

...some more html for the footer...
</pre>


<p>And then I created two other layouts of this kind (this is the most simple one):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
--default.ctp--
<?php
echo $this->renderLayout('<div id="container">'.$content_for_layout.'</div>','base');
?>
</pre>


<p>This layout simply wraps the content in a container div and passes it along to the base layout. The other layout had a lot more html around the content but that would be less clear to display like this.
</p>


<h3>Onwards and upwards</h3>

<p>Those were the steps I took to migrate and improve my application this time around. Not all of them are necessary but all of them help the application improve and conform to new conventions. For example, old string conditions still work but using the new array notation lets Cake protect you from SQL injection, makes it easier to modify conditions in behaviors and beforeFind() and other advantages big and small.
</p>


<p>If you find that any aspect of the migration is lacking in detail or plain missing, please don&#8217;t hesitate to drop me a line in the comments. Hopefully I will be able to cover such requests in future updates.
