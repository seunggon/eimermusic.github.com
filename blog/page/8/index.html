  <div class="entry-content"><p>I thought this was worth noting even though <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.isset.php#89651">a comment on php.net explain it very well</a>.</p>

<p><strong>You can not rely on isset() for associative arrays unless you know for a fact you are checking an array.</strong></p>

<p>That is: in case the variable you think is an array is in fact a string you will be in trouble. The reason being that you can access characters in a string using array notation. And since PHP is dynamically typed you can end up checking a string by mistake (or by malicious data from the browser).</p>

<p>Since CakePHP is full of associative arrays this is bound to happen to most people sooner or later. I have stumbled on this once when I was dealing with serialized data. I used isset() to check wether the data was serialized or not.</p>

<p>Here is a little example. Both checks will return true.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
<?php
$test = array(
    'data' => 'some data'
);
$test2 = array(
    'data' => array('key'=>'val')
);

echo isset($test['data']['key']);
echo ' - ';
echo isset($test2['data']['key']);
?>
</pre>


<p>There are a number of ways to get around this problem. One if to use array_key_exists(). Another is to use is_array() alongside isset().</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week (november, 2009) I installed <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> as the CMS for this website. I wanted to explain the rationale behind this move. I&#8217;ll explain why a web-developer would get an &#8220;off the rack&#8221; CMS and on top of that pick a commercial theme template to go with it.</p>

<h2>Why not build my own CMS?</h2>

<p>Why indeed. I did this once upon a time, back in 2002 and then a revised one in 2004. Then I got into Flash for a while and built a few versions of this website in Flash one with my CMS as the backend. <a href="http://portfolio.eimermusic.com/">My portfolio</a> is still in Flash.</p>

<p>Why not keep the tradition going? A competent web-developer like me (hrm..) should surely be able to cobble something together himself, right? Well, I started a new CMS a few months ago, on my vacation, but working full-time (and then some), being a new father, buying a house and all the rest of the thing called life does take up most of my time. In short: Progress was slow and ambitions were high.</p>

<p>I wanted a CMS, blog, specific video-blog, specific music-publishing section&#8230; all of is brilliantly well-crafted and polished. And that was just for v1.0 :)</p>

<h2>How I evaluated CMSes</h2>

<p>So I did a reality-check and came to the conclusion that an open-source CMS would be the only way of getting something half-decent online again before <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190080/">the apocalypse</a>. I looked at and installed a lot of the big players out there. <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>, <a href="http://textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a>, <a href="http://expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a>, even <a href="http://cms.thewikies.com/">CMS.txt</a> and probably a few more I have already forgotten about.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, and despite some <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/09/regarding_wordpress_and_security">bad press</a> of late, I found that Wordpress had the most to offer. This was aided in no small part by the release of <a href="http://basicmaths.subtraction.com/">the theme</a> I ended up choosing.</p>

<p>Wordpress is very feature-rich but not really perfect for me in any way. It just seems like the only choice for an open-sourced CMS/blog combo. MT is a perl cgi and this just doesn&#8217;t excite me. EE, and also MT to some extent, is a strange half-open project. This makes choosing the correct version a bit of a mess, especially at the stage where I download and install my candidates. How do i judge the commercial features without paying for a license for each product? TP and certainly CMS.txt did not really suit what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>I did not look closely at all the hosted CMSes out there. They look tasty but I host on my own hardware and it doesn&#8217;t cost me a dime to do so. (That&#8217;s what friends are for.)</p>

<p>When it came to the theme I, again, opted for the time-saver. Basic Maths was released very conveniently just when I was trying to find the time to start porting my layout to Wordpress. I have created a WP theme before once but didn&#8217;t like it much.</p>

<p>[caption id=&#8221;attachment_86&#8221; align=&#8221;alignnone&#8221; width=&#8221;444&#8221; caption=&#8221;This website, left from 2004 and right from 2002&#8221;]<img src="http://www.eimermusic.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/webdesign-comp.jpg" alt="This website, left from 2004 and right from 2002" title="original website designs" width="444" height="186" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-86" />[/caption]
This website has always had a pretty clean and simple look. Basic Maths looks a lot like what I had and was aiming for. And I looked at subtraction.com for some of the inspiration for the design. It was an easy choice. I am likely to modify and mutate the theme over time (I already have) but it is a wonderful starting point. The html and css is very clear and learning some of the finer details of Wordpress themes from this one is a joy.</p>

<p>I aim to follow this up with some of the little things I learn about Wordpress.</p>

<time datetime="2009-09-02T00:00:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 2<span>nd</span>, 2009</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This article will try to explain how I build a modular application using plugins. I will cover how I implement them and integrate them into the main application.
</p>


<h2>Definition</h2>

<p>There are a lot of different ideas around about what to put into the CakePHP plugins directory. In this article a plugin extends the application kind-of like a plugin in Photoshop.</p>

<ul>
    <li>A plugin does not extend CakePHP or &#8220;any&#8221; application. It is specific to &#8220;this&#8221; application.</li>
    <li>A plugin may (or rather should) depend on the application.</li>
    <li>The application may not depend on any one plugin.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Context</h2>

<p>We need some context. An example application and how it makes use of plugins. I have chosen the application I continually develop at work. It is a system for communicating with mobile phones. Primarily via SMS and MMS. (That is: text messages and picture/video messages to most people.) I will use simplified and generalised features of this application to exemplify the design and implementation of plugins.</p>

<h2>The design</h2>

<p>The application has certain obvious core features. User management, managing phone numbers, sending SMS and MMS, receiving SMS and MMS, reporting on all transactions and other similar features.</p>

<p>Each concrete end-user feature is implemented as a plugin.
A few examples:
A newsletters module used to send offers and news to customers.
A feedback module used to receive and automatically publish incoming feedback from customers on the client&#8217;s website among other things.
An opinions module to manage quick opinion polls.
A subscriptions module and many others.</p>

<p>Each of these make use of incoming and/or outgoing SMS and MMS messages in some way. Each one uses stored phone numbers. They all manage these things by making use of core features.</p>

<h2>How plugins talk to the main application</h2>

<p>This is the simple and obvious bit. A plugin can very simply just extend or associate itself with some resource in the main application.
As an example (finally some code!), a subscriber model would look like this.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
<?php  
class SubsSubscriber extends SubsAppModel { 
    var $name = 'SubsSubscriber';     
    var $belongsTo = array( 
        'Phone', 
        'SubsSubscription'=>array( 
            'className'    => 'Subs.SubsSubscription', 
            'counterCache' => true 
        ) 
    ); 
} 
?>
</pre>


<p>Not only does the subscriber belong to a subscription, it also belongs to a phone. Creating a Subscriber involves registering the subscriber&#8217;s phone number with the Phone model. This ensures that there are no duplicate numbers, that any restrictions put on a certain phone is retained across the app. Things like that. The Phone model implements this registration method.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
function register($number) { 
    $number = clean_phone($number); // utility function to normalize number formatting 

    // not a real phone number: abort 
    if ( empty($number) ) { 
        return false; 
    } 
     
    // look for existing registration  
    $phone = $this->find('first',array( 
        'conditions'=>array( $this->alias.'.number'=>$number ) 
    )); 
     
    if ( !empty($phone) ) { 
        // found it, return it 
        return $phone; 
    } 

    // new number 
    $this->create(); 
    $data = array( 
        $this->alias=>array( 
            'number'=>$number 
        ) 
    ); 
     
    if ( $this->save($data) ) { 
        return $this->read(); 
    } else { 
        return false; 
    }     
}
</pre>


<p>That is really the basics behind how plugins interact with the main application. Similarly when a plugin needs to send an SMS, this is done using the SendSmsComponent in the main application. This component abstracts all the messy SOAP garbage phone-operators implement. :) Me, cranky? You bet!</p>

<h2>How about the other way around?</h2>

<p>The less obvious part is how the main application communicates back to the plugins. If I was starting out today I would certainly implement Eventful from cakealot.com, or something like Teknoid&#8217;s observer pattern. I did something a bit different.</p>

<p>I keep all plugins in a table accessed via a model. That way I can have an administrative GUI to activate and deactivate different plugins for different clients. I also simplifies handling of permissions to plugins and menu-generation and other things. It is possible to get by with simply reading the app/plugins directory and caching that.</p>

<p>AppController implements some empty methods used as callbacks or event handlers of sorts. As an example, when an SMS message is received in the main application it parses the message and locates the plugin that should receive it. It stores the message in the central SMS model and notifies the plugin that a new message with the ID=123 has arrived and that the plugin should do something about it.</p>

<p>What happens next if of-course all up to the plugin. It may register the sender as a new subscriber, unregister the sender, post the message to the web, send an email, reply automatically&#8230; anything it wants. The point is that it is up to the plugin to decide.</p>

<p>The application does this via the much debated requestAction:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
$this->requestAction('/'.$module['Module']['name'].'/on_incoming_sms/'.$saved['IncomingSms']['id'], array('return')); 
</pre>


<p>And each plugin would implement this method to do something with the message. This is done in the &#8220;PluginnameController&#8221; as the request goes to /pluginname/on_incoming_sms/123. There is a positive side-effect to this. If I want some core feature to be called in this way I can make add a controller to the table of &#8220;modules&#8221; and requestAction will never know the difference. (This is why I still use a string url.)</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
function on_incoming_sms($id = null) { 
    $this->autoRender = false; 
    if ( !isset($this->params['requested']) || empty($id) ) { // check that we are contacted "from within" 
        return false; 
    } 
    // do something useful here and return the id as confirmation 
    return $id; 
}
</pre>


<p>Now I feel the need to get a bit on the defensive. I can almost hear people shouting about thin controllers, fat models and the evil of requestAction. This is communication. that is the exactly what controllers are meant to do. In Cake this is usually between the browser and the models but in this case it is between the app and it&#8217;s plugins. I don&#8217;t have any such logical reason for using requestAction except that is is by far the most convenient way of achieving this kind of communication. Since these calls are usually done from either an API call (incoming sms) or from a cron shell any increase in request time is not a great priority. People get annoyed by an extra 0.4sec, a cron job doesn&#8217;t :)</p>

<h2>Speaking of Cron jobs</h2>

<p>Housekeeping is done via cron. I have cron call a Cake shell every hour. This shell finds all modules and calls each one in turn. Again, the main application does not know or care about what each module is up to. One may update a cached view, another may remove expired items, another may send scheduled messages and guess what the Reports module does each hour?</p>

<p>This is an example of such a shell</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
class HourlyShell extends Shell { 

    var $tasks = array('LogRotation'); 
    var $uses = array('Module'); 
     
    function main() { 
        $this->out('Hourly shell updates'); 
        $this->log('Hourly shell updates @ '.date('Y-m-d H:i:s'), 'cron'); 
         
        $this->LogRotation->execute(); 
         
        $this->update_plugins();         
    } 
     
    function update_plugins() { 
        $this->out('Updating plugins:'); 
        $modules = $this->Module->find('list', array( 
                'fields' => 'Module.controller', 
                'conditions' => array('Module.installed'=>'1'), 
                'recursive' => -1 
            ) 
        ); 

        foreach ( $modules as $module) { 
            $this->out('> '.$module); 
            $this->requestAction('/'.$module.'/on_hourly_update', array('return'=>true, 'bare'=>1)); 
        } 
    } 
}
</pre>


<p>The method being called will typically just pass the call along to one or more parts of the module that need to do something periodic. For example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums" lang="php">
function on_hourly_update() {
    // the template in AppController can be used to check that the call is legitimate.
    if ( parent::on_hourly_update() ) {
        $this->SubsSubscription->deleteExpired();
    }
}
</pre>


<h2>A bonus trick</h2>

<p>One cool thing that may not be apparent is that it is very easy to build a new feature as a normal controller and then turn it into a plugin. The trick is to name the plugin after the controller it should replace. Then you take the controller and make it the PluginnameController for that plugin. Cake will pass any call to that controller automatically. Example time:</p>

<p>/news/edit/123 - would be seen as /controller/action/param
/news/edit/123 - can also be be seen as /plugin/controller/action
but since there is no edit controller in the news plugin Cake will try:
/news/edit/123 - as /plugin{/pluginname}/action/param ending up in the PluginnameController and the edit action.</p>

<p>You will have to move the model and views to the plugin too, of-course.</p>

<h2>Closing remarks</h2>

<p>That is the basic gist of how I have chosen to design a modular system based on plugins. If you feel I have left something out, please comment and I will answer or update the article.</p>

<p>Plugins make up most end-user features.
Plugins rely on models, components, elements and other code from the main application.
The main application can pass events and information to plugins via the PluginnameController in each plugin.</p>

<p>I have left out tricks and hacks to keep the article focused. In the real application I use a patch to the dispatcher class that reformats urls for plugins. News plugin has NewsMessagesController but showing /news/news_messages/index in the url is redundant to say the least. The patch allowsme to use urls like /news/messages/index and have the dispatcher prepend the plugin name to the controller name. Since most urls point to plugins I chose to patch the core for this feature. It is not necessary to do any such patch to make use of plugins but for me it made plugins a more attractive option as the foundation of most features.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all. Thanks for reading.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The variable scope in javascript can still surprise me. This is a nice one I debugged today:</p>

<p>A variable that is not defined by &#8220;var&#8221; have a global scope. This can be a real pain since the globalization is implicit and easy to forget.</p>

<p>I forgot the &#8220;var&#8221; when writing a for loop and could not for the life of me figure out what happened when the i-variable got mysteriously reset.</p>

<p>This is an example of a foor loop (in one()) that will never finnish since i is being reset in two(). Defining &#8220;var i=0&#8221; and all is well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
When you need to gather statistics and reporting data from a large number of transactions (easily >1&#8217;000&#8217;000 rows) you need to transfer that data over to a reporting-friendly format to keep request times down. One popular database design for this is called a Star Schema. This is a simple re-usable StarSchema setup for CakePHP.
</p>




<p>
To make heads and tails of the following it help to have some basic understanding of star schemas and why anyone would use OLAP. If your gut-reaction is &#8220;Why not just do a find on the transaction data and format a reporting view from that?&#8221; then you should at least give the following page a look.
</p>


<p><a href="http://ciobriefings.com/Publications/WhitePapers/DesigningtheStarSchemaDatabase/tabid/101/Default.aspx">http://ciobriefings.com/&#8230;</a></p>

<h4>When do I need this?</h4>


<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The data you are reporting on is growing and your app is slowing down</li>
<li>The data is not stored the way you want to &#8220;view it&#8221; in your reports</li>
<li>You need to &#8220;view&#8221; your data in various different ways in your reports</li>
</ul>




<h4> Disclaimer</h4>


<p></p>

<p>
This article is to provide an implementation of a star schema setup for Cake. You still need to know how to DESIGN your schema. It is very important to plan ahead and create a schema that will accomodate ALL the ways (dimensions) you want to display your data. It is  a bit tricky to alter the schema afterwards.
</p>


<p>
This code uses some of ugly messy code that improves performance. The database goes against some Cake conventions (no pk!). It also contains some ugly messy code that is the fault of the author (me). Also this setup has only been run and tested on MySQL and uses a custom dbo that can put dynamic data into a Model&#8217;s resultset.
</p>


<p>
This article is about the star schema implementation. It could be extended to aggregated tables to improve display performance even further. How to do this is not explained here.

</ul>


<h3>Extended DBO</h3>

<p>
I found this extended DBO a long time ago. Credit should go where credit is due but I have lost the reference to the original author. The DBO did more but I picked out the resultSet() method which is what we need here. To get an extended mysqli driver replace the &#8220;mysql_&#8230;&#8221; methods with &#8220;mysqli_&#8230;&#8221;
</p>

<h3>Fact Model</h3>

<p>
The abstract fact model, the super, the parent, which all concrete fact models extend.
</p>


<p>
FactModel implements a few custom methods that are common among fact models. findFacts() is a custom find method that joins the fact model with all its dimensions and returns a nice data array with the requested fact. saveFact() is a custom save method that uses a custom query to automatically update each row if it exists already. This is done to improve performance (a lot).

<h3>Example FactSentSms</h3>

<p>
A simple example of a concrete model extending FactModel. This one tracks outgoing SMS messages for a few dimensions. More on dimensions shortly.
</p>


<p>
In this example the gather() method is quite simple. It could contain any number of complex calculations or pulling of associated data. This method does all the heavy lifting of the data and an initial gathering of an existing transaction table can take a long time.

Notice that the fact table contains a field referencing the original primary key from the transaction table. This is to ensure that we can update the data without accidentally overwriting rows or creating duplicates. The table definition makes a unique key of the composite of all dimensions and this id. There is no primary key, by design.

<h3>Dimension Models</h3>

<p>
The dimension models are often simple. They only implement one custom method (also often simple): getDimensionFor(). This method takes a single record from the transaction model and figures out which dimension it belongs to. E.G. It can look at the created field and find the right time dimension to match that timestamp. It can check the a status code and simply map to a record representing that code.
</p>


<p>
The following example is a time dimension with a daily grain. I.E. the smallest increment in time is a day. I chose this dimension as the example since it is one that can be re-used, often without modification. If you look at gather() (above) you can see that I let MySQL do all the heavy calculations to pick out the date components. The method tries to find an existing dimension record and failing that it creates a new record. Simple pimple!
</p>


<p>
This example also implements the most basic form of caching. Since the dimensions usually contain a very limited number of records caching each one in memory will dramatically increase the performance of the gathering process. Say you have the price dimension with 10 prices (that is 10 records) and 800&#8217;000 transactions to map. Evenly distributed, each price record will be queried 80&#8217;000 times. 79&#8217;999 times to many. So by caching the queries you save your database 799&#8217;990 redundant queries just for a single dimension. My simple cache is a lot faster than using cacheQueries, probably because it is so very basic. When it is all that is needed I will gladly take the performance boost.

        return $dim_time<'DimensionTime'><'id'>;
    }
    
}
</pre>

<p>
Then just rinse and repeat. Each dimension is very similar in its design. You just have to figure out what key values you need to store to define the desired &#8220;grain&#8221;. Often this is a simple as using the categories a product can be in or the different status codes returned for a message.
</p>


### A ReportsController example
<p>
This is a simple ReportsController that uses the model FactSentSms to get statistics for pretty charts in the view. (Charts will not be covered here.) The first example method below is used to load up data for stats showing how many messages have been sent per weekday. The fact you find is usually a SUM(), COUNT() or AVG() or some other SQL function.
</p>
<p>
It looks a lot like a normal find. You can use order and conditions like normal. In the first example we only way to count records where the response code is a successful transaction (you need to know our system to know exactly why they are this way). but for and error report we want the opposite.
</p>
<p>
Group takes on a slightly special meaning here. It is used to define the dimension(s) from which to view the data. In the first example simply the day of week from the time dimension. You can add more groupings to get your data returned as a multi-dimensional array, as in the modules_and_types() method.
</p>
<p>
Mapped is a nifty little thing that replaces numerical array keys (0-n) with meaningful keys like: monday-sunday or 1-7 for day of week and  1-31 for day of month. It is a bit like findList() in that it prepares your data for the table or graph in the view.

### Conclusion  
<p>
I hope you can start to see the benefits. Once the schema is setup we can write any number of reporting queries and &#8220;look at&#8221; the data from many different directions very quickly. For example, doing the weekly example on ≈220&#8217;000 records on our system is just over a second for the full Cake request cycle including rendering of the html. That is pretty dang good for a single (2 year old) rack server if you ask me.
</p>
<p>
If you design your dimensions cleverly they can be re-used for many fact tables. The time dimension is a prime candidate here. I can use that for all reports of all types of facts since it check for the generic created field.
